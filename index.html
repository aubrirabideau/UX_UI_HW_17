                        <p>She is a proponent for the details and giving the client what they want. She designs with a 
                            proactive attitude using empathy to drive her decisions and problem solving process.

                        <p>Before finding UX/UI, Aubri wanted to persue a career as a pastry chef. She attened Escoffier School 
                            of Culinary Arts and began working in bakeries, restuarants and food trucks. She lost her passion for 
                            it during Covid so she needed to pivot. She was able to work in construction and then decided creativity 
                            was missing in her life. UX/UI found her and along with opening a pottery business her spark has returned.
